    <h2>Creation & Development</h2>
    <p id="description">
        In 1962, with the success of the Fantastic Four, Marvel Comics editor and
         head writer Stan Lee was casting for a new superhero idea. He said the 
         idea for Spider-Man arose from a surge in teenage demand for comic books 
         and the desire to create a character with whom teens could identify.[15]:1 
         As with Fantastic Four, Lee saw Spider-Man as an opportunity to "get out of 
         his system" what he felt was missing in comic books.[16] In his autobiography, 
         Lee cites the non-superhuman pulp magazine crime fighter the Spider as a
         great influence,[14]:130[17] and in a multitude of print and video interviews, Lee
         stated he was inspired by seeing a spider climb up a wallâ€”adding 
         in his autobiography that he has told that story so often he has become 
         unsure of whether or not this is true.
